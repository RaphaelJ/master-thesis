# Very fast web traffic generator on a Tilera device

## Abstract

This document summarizes the design and development of a light-weight,
user-space, event-driven and highly-scalable *TCP/IP* network stack.

A simple web-server using this new framework got a 2.6Ã— performance
improvement, when compared to the same application layer running on the new
reusable *TCP* sockets introduced in *Linux 3.9*. The web-server was able to
deliver static *HTML* pages at a rate of 12 Gbps *TCP* on a *Tilera TILE-Gx36*
36-core processor.

This number could be significantly improved by carrying out some optimizations 
that have not been implemented yet (because of a limitation of time resources)
or by porting the network stack to a faster CPU architecture.

The network stack was developed with the ultimate goal of creating a very fast
HTTP traffic simulator to certify layer-4 middleboxes for very high network
load.
